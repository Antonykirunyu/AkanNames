        <h3><strong><em>The untold story.</em></strong></h3>
        <p>The naming system in Ghana is very unique and
             unlike any other system in the world.The 
             child is not assigned a name before the eighth
             day because during that period it is considered
             as a stranger from the ancestral world who 
             has come for a visit.Days of the week in Ghana
             are very important aspects of the naming culture.
            In Ghana everyone is supposed to have a day name 
             in addition to his other names,which will be 
             disclosed in due course.The day of the week on 
             hich one is born determines what name he is called.
            There are day names for each of the seven days. 
            The names come in pairs for each day;one for a
             male,the other for a female born on that day.
