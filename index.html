<h3><strong><em>The untold story.</em></strong></h3>
<p>The naming system in Ghana is very unique and
     <br>unlike any other system in the world.The 
     <br>child is not assigned a name before the eighth
     <br>day because during that period it is considered
     <br>as a stranger from the ancestral world who 
     <br>has come for a visit.Days of the week in Ghana
     <br>are very important aspects of the naming culture.
     <br>In Ghana everyone is supposed to have a day name 
     <br>in addition to his other names,which will be 
     <br>disclosed in due course.The day of the week on 
     <br>which one is born determines what name he is called.
     <br>There are day names for each of the seven days. 
     <br>The names come in pairs for each day;one for a
     <br>male,the other for a female born on that day.
